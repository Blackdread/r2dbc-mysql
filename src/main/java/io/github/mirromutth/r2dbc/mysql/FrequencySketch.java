     * This class maintains a 4-bit CountMinSketch [1] with periodic aging to provide the popularity
     * history for the TinyLfu admission policy [2]. The time and space efficiency of the sketch
     * allows it to cheaply estimate the frequency of an entry in a stream of cache access events.
     *
     * The counter matrix is represented as a single dimensional array holding 16 counters per slot. A
     * fixed depth of four balances the accuracy and cost, resulting in a width of four times the
     * length of the array. To retain an accurate estimation the array's length equals the maximum
     * number of entries in the cache, increased to the closest power-of-two to exploit more efficient
     * bit masking. This configuration results in a confidence of 93.75% and error bound of e / width.
     *
     * The frequency of all entries is aged periodically using a sampling window based on the maximum
     * number of entries in the cache. This is referred to as the reset operation by TinyLfu and keeps
     * the sketch fresh by dividing all counters by two and subtracting based on the number of odd
     * counters found. The O(n) cost of aging is amortized, ideal for hardware prefetching, and uses
     * inexpensive bit manipulations per array location.
